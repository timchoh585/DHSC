put in the images
  white for current class, black for not in that class
    maybe have gray for classes that have already passed
vibrate when 5 minutes to class
  if they are not in class, then vibrate
  if they have a free period, dont vibrate (especially if they dont have EB classes!)
have something that can optimise the science classes
  ask what lab days they have
    ask what times are the lab periods
    (dont think im going to do because that is incredibly difficult to do
        for every single option of labs)
have an edit feature that can allow the users to edit their schedule
