put in the images
  white for current class, black for not in that class
    maybe have gray for classes that have already passed
vibrate when 5 minutes to class
  if they are not in class, then vibrate
  if they have a free period, dont vibrate (especially if they dont have EB classes!)
have something that can optimise the science classes
  ask what lab days they have
    ask what times are the lab periods
    (dont think im going to do because that is incredibly difficult to do
        for every single option of labs)
incorporate a method that reads from a .txt file (or something else) that takes in the calander
    from 'Month, day, cycle' and the method would check for the date and cycle and then print out
    what the proper schedule is.
add another method that will work with split day schedule for 56 and 34 days.  second half first and
    one for the first half first.  Work with both types of days.
